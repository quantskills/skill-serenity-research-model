# Serenity Research Model

Use this skill to turn Serenity public materials into a reproducible research model. The goal is not to verify private profits or copy trades; the goal is to reverse-engineer observable reasoning patterns from public posts and test how those public signals behaved afterward.

## Core Workflow

1. Collect public materials.
   - Prefer user-provided X exports, saved post URLs, copied threads, archived HTML, CSV, JSON, or manually curated notes.
   - TweetClaw can provide public X/Twitter search, reply, and user-post exports when source URLs, authors, timestamps, and retrieval dates are preserved. Do not import follower lists; public follower or engagement counts are context only.
   - If browsing is needed, gather only public posts and public summaries. Record source URLs and retrieval date.
   - Do not treat screenshots, follower claims, or viral return numbers as verified account performance.

2. Normalize posts into the data contract in `references/data_contract.md`.
   - Use `scripts/serenity_mvp.py extract --posts <file> --out <dir>`.
   - Supported input: `.csv`, `.json`, `.jsonl`, `.txt`, `.md`.
   - Minimum fields are `created_at` and `text`; include `url`, `id`, and `author` when available.
   - For TweetClaw exports, follow `references/tweetclaw_import.md` and drop credentials, tokens, cookies, request headers, private DMs, drafts, and unpublished account data before running the pipeline.

3. Decompose each post at the smallest useful unit.
   - Ticker or asset mention
   - Theme and subtheme
   - Bottleneck claim
   - Supply-chain role
   - Evidence type
   - Catalyst
   - Time horizon
   - Risk marker
   - Conviction signal
   - Follow-up or revision relationship

4. Clean and review the first-pass extraction.
   - Use `scripts/serenity_mvp.py clean --signals <signals.csv> --posts <source_posts.csv> --out <dir>`.
   - If only a stats file is available, use `--ticker-stats <ticker_stats.txt>` as a fallback.
   - The cleaner filters ticker candidates against the source cashtag whitelist, preserves theme-only rows, and creates review files for quotes, disclaimers, sarcasm-like language, and no-ticker thematic posts.
   - After manually reviewing priority rows, use `scripts/serenity_mvp.py auto-review --signals <manual_review_queue.csv> --out <dir>` to apply learned first-pass semantic labels such as quote-only, retrospective track record, crowdsourced watchlist, broad basket, active thesis, and post-event explainer.

5. Evaluate public calls only when price data is available.
   - Use `scripts/serenity_mvp.py evaluate --signals <signals.csv> --prices <price_dir> --out <dir>`.
   - Price files must be one CSV per ticker, named `<TICKER>.csv`, with `date` and `close`.
   - Report 1, 5, 20, 60, and 120 trading-day forward returns plus max drawdown where possible.

6. Build the research model report.
   - Use `scripts/serenity_mvp.py report --signals <signals.csv> --out <dir>`.
   - If evaluation output exists, include it in the final interpretation.
   - Use `references/serenity_axes.md` when converting observations into a model.

## Interpretation Rules

- Separate observable facts from inferred logic.
- Mark any claimed returns as unverified unless they come from audited records, broker statements, competition results, or a clearly inspectable portfolio record.
- Distinguish research posts from price-moving posts. A viral post can become part of the catalyst.
- Track failed, stale, and revised ideas with the same care as successful ones.
- Avoid building a model only from winners. Include neutral mentions and follow-up corrections when data exists.
- State the data boundary: which posts were included, which were missing, and whether replies/highlights/quotes were captured.

## Output Contract

For a completed MVP run, produce:

- `signals.csv`: one row per ticker-level public signal.
- `theme_summary.csv`: aggregated themes, evidence types, and conviction markers.
- `manual_review_queue.csv`: rows that need human review for quote context, no-ticker themes, disclaimers, or ambiguous rhetoric.
- `quote_relationships.csv`: rows where the signal depends on quoted text.
- `manual_review_priority_top200_reviewed.csv` or another `*_reviewed.csv`: semantic review labels with decision, weight, and reason.
- `correction_log.md`: documented cleaning rules and counts.
- `serenity_model_report.md`: concise report with profile, logic tree, evidence map, risk map, and reusable research checklist.
- Optional `signal_evaluation.csv`: forward-return evaluation from price data.

## When Extending

After the Serenity MVP works, use the same schema to compare another trader. Only create a generalized trader-skill generator after at least two trader-specific runs expose stable common fields and failure modes.
